# raspilisp
A (Common) Lisp Compiler &amp; OS for the Raspberry PI from scratch.

Personal hobby project in which I would like to build a compiler and an operating system that implements Common Lisp.  The target platform will be a Raspberry PI v3.  During the project I hope to learn more about compilers, operating systems, and Lisp.
